# Welcome

Welcome aboard — your journey starts here!

This post will provide you with a high-level overview of our **purpose**, the **values** that align us, and what we’re **collectively working towards.**

We hope this will make you feel at home in our community, and act as a springboard for further exploration.


## What is our purpose?

Minima was born out of the desire to build a network that **empowers freedom for all.** 

We believe everyone should have **equal opportunity** to **create**, **communicate** and **collaborate** —  so we cooperate within our network to achieve this goal.

## What are our values?

Our values are our moral compass that guide how we interact with others in our community. If you share these same values, you’re already a Minimalist. 

**Collaboration:** Minima is about collaboration, not competition. What is good for you is good for me. Working together and being transparent with each other is a fundamental part of what makes Minima tick.

**Participation:** Like the protocol, we will only succeed if everyone is an active participant. Put the work in, and you will be rewarded.

**Empowerment:** We are working for freedom, and so we give everyone the freedom they need to thrive. No matter who you are. 

**Accountability:** With empowerment comes accountability. We trust each other to take responsibility when things go wrong, making sure that we first attempt to resolve any issues ourselves.

We’re building a future where everyone can freely connect and prosper — [join us](https://linktr.ee/minima_global?utm_source=linktree_profile_share&ltsid=f5b69262-8b95-4bc2-abc9-abf28ce9f92b). 



## What are we working towards?

**1 million validating and constructing nodes.** We do the minimum amount of work required independently, to secure the chain with the maximum amount of work collectively — so the scale of members running a node matters. 

For Mainnet launch, 1 million nodes is a number we believe is robust enough to handle real-world value and information to be exchanged. 

You can help achieve this and **earn Minima** by [running a node](https://incentive.minima.global/account/register) and [inviting your friends](https://docs.minima.global/docs/earnrewards/minimainviteprogram) to do the same.
