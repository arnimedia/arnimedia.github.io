# What is Minima?

## The ultra-light Blockchain

Minima is a finished, Quantum secure, proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain and peer-to-peer network designed for mobile and IoT devices. 

Every individual (or device) running the Minima protocol is a node runs a full constructing and validating node, and therefore contributes to the censorship resistance of the network. Minima uses cooperative consensus mechanisms, rather than competitive, thereby encouraging greater decentralization over time. The network is secured by accumulating vast sums of small resource contributions (PoW) rather than competing to provide as much resource as possible. 
The Minima blockchain uses the Minima currency as a store of value and medium of exchange, enabling peer-to-peer value transfer to any participant on the Minima network.
