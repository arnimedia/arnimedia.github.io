# Why use Minima?

## The world’s first completely decentralized blockchain
Everyone running Minima is working together to secure the network. Unlike miners, we are not competing, we are collaborating, as equals. And when everyone is equal the network becomes 100% decentralized.

## The only blockchain controlled entirely by its users.
With true decentralization comes maximum censorship resistance.
Users can transfer value, access information and freely connect with each other without limits.
Minima is built on principles of collaboration, participation, empowerment and accountability.

## The only blockchain to run in full on a mobile phone
Minima is so small that an entire validating and constructing node runs easily on a  single mobile phone. The Minima blockchain doesn’t rely on others to verify, which makes it a uniquely trustless chain.
