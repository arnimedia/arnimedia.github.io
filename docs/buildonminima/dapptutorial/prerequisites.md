# Pre-requisites
There are no special hardware requirements for building a MiniDapp. 

Before you start to create MiniDapps, you will need several things:

1. Java installed on your computer. Download from [here](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp) (this is required for running Minima)

2. A running Minima node (on the latest version) - see the [Run a Node](/docs/runanode/get_started_in_3_steps) section

3. A code editor to write your code, we recommend [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) but this is your own preference

4. An understanding of how the Minima Protocol works by reading the [Learn](https://docs.minima.global/docs/learn/networkoverview) section 

Throughout this tutorial you should have Minimaâ€™s Command Line Interface (CLI) open.

If running Minima on a mobile device, this is the Terminal MiniDapp.
