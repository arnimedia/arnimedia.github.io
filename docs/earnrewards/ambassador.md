# Ambassador Program

## The Minima Ambassador Program

Welcome to the Minima Ambassador Program, where we recognise you participating in the conversation on our Discord Server and reward you for inviting others to join in.

We will also be using this program to thank you for participating in activities and tasks that help us tell the world about Minima - after all, the stronger the community, the stronger the network.


## How can I participate in the Ambassador Program ? 
You're automatically enrolled as soon as you join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/minima). Then head to https://ambassador.minima.global/ to see our active tasks open for submission! 

You will receive XP and, occasionally, Minima coins for the tasks you complete, tasks come in all shapes and forms!

## How does it work?

Performing certain actions on our Discord Server will earn you Experience Points (XP).

Participating in useful, helpful or insightful conversations on the server will earn you 10 XP. A friend joining the server and setting you as their Inviter will earn 100 XP. There will also be activities, tasks and competitions you can participate in which will earn you XP Bonuses.

When certain levels of XP are achieved, you will gain a new Ambassador Rank and unlock new activities, opportunities and perks.

Additionally each month the user with the most XP earned will win the title of King/Queen of the Server, giving them top tier perks for 30 days. The rest of the Top 10 will get bonus XP.

## What about my old Invite Rank?
Donâ€™t worry - if you had an Invite Rank you will find that it has been transferred across to the Ambassador Program and you will have an Ambassador Rank that is equivalent. No one will need to start from 0.

## How do I invite someone to the server?
Great question! Discord recently changed their Terms & Conditions meaning that tracking invite links became a banned activity. Instead those you invite have to manually indicate that you are the one that invited them.

The process you need to follow is:

1. Create an invite link to the check-tier channel
2. Give this link to your friend
3. When they join the server, they must run this command **rank!m @yourDiscordTag set inviter**. Each person can only run the command once, but there is no limit on the number of times you can be set as the inviter.

## What is the Ambassador Lounge?
A private space for Minimalists & above to get hyped, share advice, coordinate and share Ambassador success stories. Ambassador Program Updates will be provided here by the Community Team.

## What is the Ambassador Task Channel?
Available to Maximalists & above, you will find tasks here for everyone to participate in to help spread the message and opportunity of Minima! In return for completing these tasks, you will earn bonus XP.

## What is the Early Access Channel?
Available to Maximalists & above, you will find opportunities to test new versions of Minima and MiniDapps ahead of main release. Some tests might be open to all, some might have more specific requirements - but all will attract bonus XP and maybe even some extra Incentive Reward Tokens ;)

## What is the Ambassador Bounty Channel?
This channel is available to Minima Ambassadors & Minima Grand Ambassadors only. Here you will find larger tasks, which require more time, effort and coordination.

The nature of them will mean that they might not be open to all either, but instead could require an application being made to specific people within the Minima Team.

As these tasks are much more involved and specific they attract Incentive Reward Token Bounties.
