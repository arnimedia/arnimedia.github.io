- **No partnership or agency:** Nothing in these Terms constitutes, or will be deemed to constitute, a partnership between the parties nor make any party the agent of another party.
- **Assignment:** We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms (but without your prior express consent), provided that we assign these Terms on the same terms or terms that are no less advantageous to you. You must not assign your rights and obligations under these Terms.
- **Waiver:** Any right or remedy granted to us for breach of these Terms will be in addition to all other rights and remedies available to us. If we fail or delay to exercise any right or remedy, or only exercise the same in part, this does not mean that it waives such right or remedy in full in the future.

Notices will be deemed received, if sent by first class post, on the second working day after posting or, if sent by email, at the time of transmission.

- **Governing law and jurisdiction:** These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of, or in connection with, it, its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) will be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of England and Wales and the parties agree that courts of England and Wales will have exclusive to settle such disputes or claims.
