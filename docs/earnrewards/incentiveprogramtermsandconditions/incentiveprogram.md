# Incentive Program

The Incentive Program rewards users for downloading our app and running a complete node. In order to participate in the Incentive Program, you need to have a referral invite link (Link) or join the waiting list. Simply downloading a node from our Website does not enrol you into the Incentive Program.

There is a limited number of Links available and while we wish that everyone could participate in the Incentive Program, we make no guarantees that you will receive the Link even if you join the waiting list.

Once you receive the Link, you will need to download our app on your Android mobile, PC or Mac. You will then need to create your account by using your email address to enrol into the Incentive Program. We will also ask you some additional questions to verify and confirm your identity. For information on how we will store your personal data (i.e., your email address), please see our Privacy Notice here: https://minima.global/privacy-policy

Once your account is created, you will earn 1 Minima Coin per day (Coin). The Coin will be stored on a database and does not hold any value until mainnet launch and you agree not to use it for speculative purposes. We may also provide you with the Links which you could then give to your invitees. We make no promises or guarantees as to how many Links you will receive.

**BY PARTICIPATING IN THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM, RECEIVING LINKS AND COINS, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THIS DOES NOT GIVE YOU ANY RIGHT, TITLE, INTEREST, DIVIDEND, DISTRIBUTION, BENEFIT, CONTROL OR OWNERSHIP OF MINIMA GLOBAL LIMITED, AND YOU PARTICIPATE IN THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM ONLY TO FACILITATE OUR DEVELOPMENT.**
