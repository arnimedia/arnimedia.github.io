# Invite Program

## What is the Minima Invite Program?
The Minima Invite Program is designed to reward all Minima node runners that are registered with the Incentive Reward Program, for sharing us with your networks, encouraging your contacts to install and run a node and join the Minima Incentive Reward Program.

## How does it work?
Log in to your Incentive Reward Account at https://incentive.minima.global/
Click the 'Share' button located next to your ‘Invite Link’, which will copy a registration link to your clipboard
Share your link with your friends! It will take them straight to the Incentive Program registration page, where your invite code will already be in place.

## How long will this program run?
Until the Minima Token Generation Event

## How many times can my invite be used?
As many times as you like! There is no limit.

## What could you earn?
For every day a person you invite runs a node, you will earn 0.1 Minima.
So if we assume that each of your invited people run their nodes for a 100 day period, you would earn:

- **5 People Invited**  = 50 Minima
- **10 People Invited** = 100 Minima
- **15 People Invited** = 150 Minima
- **20 People Invited** =200 Minima

## That's it?

Yes! Simple as that. You will continue to earn your Invite Bonus Rewards right up until the Token Generation Event - all you need to do is share your code and make sure the people you invite, sign up to the Incentive Program using your Invite Link.

The more people you get to sign up using your code, the better for everyone! After all, the greater the node count, the greater the security of the network and the greater the rewards.

Don’t be tempted to cut corners though! It is important to remember that the Incentive Reward Program #1 rule is one account per human, we don’t want centralization of any kind. Anyone found to be running multiple accounts will lose all their rewards.
