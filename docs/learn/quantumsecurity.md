# Quantum Security

If Minima is truly expected to stand the test of time, it must be Quantum secure from the beginning. Once scaled to millions of nodes, each being complete - constructing and validating - nodes, the consensus critical components of the protocol must be finished, requiring no future changes.
Minimaâ€™s approach to Quantum security is two-fold:
## Hashing
Minima uses the Keccak hash algorithm with a hash strength of 256, considered to be post-quantum sufficient by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) see: https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/projects/hash-functions/documents/keccak-slides-at-nist.pdf

Keccak is used for TxPoW mining, block and transaction hashes, proof chains, and signing or verifying data. All of the cryptographic security of Minima is provided by hash functions.

## Signatures
Minima uses Winternitz One Time Signature (WOTS) with a Winternitz parameter of 8. WOTS is a hash based digital signature scheme which is considered quantum resistant. https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/191.pdf

The cost of being Quantum secure is that signatures are at least 10-20x as big as Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) used in Bitcoin. A one time use WOTS is 400-800 bytes. Minima signatures are certainly large when compared to normal Bitcoin transactions, but they are not kept forever since almost all data is eventually pruned, so although a bandwidth issue, they are only a temporary storage overhead

## Coloured coins
Minima is the native coin for the Minima blockchain. Each UTxO is defined as a coin and therefore a coin can be worth any amount of Minima. 
Minima supports custom tokens (including NFTs) natively. Tokens are Coloured coins. Coloured coins are tiny fractions of Minima which represent the supply of a custom token or NFT.

Custom tokens are specified by the following characteristics:

|---|----|
| TokenID | Created after all the details are set, by hashing the coinid and total amount. Each TokenID is globally unique |
| Token Name/Description | A String description that can be just a name or a full JSON. |
| CoinID | The CoinID used when creating the token initially |
| Total | The total number of these tokens |
| Decimals | The number of decimal places to use for the token |
| Script | The token script |
| Total Amount | The total amount of Minima coloured to be this token. Since Minima uses 44 decimal places, if you colour 1E-33 (0.000000000000000000000000000000001) Minima, that is 1000 tokens with 8 decimal places. i.e. 0.000000000000000000000000000000001000.00000000 |
| Scale | The scale of the Token vs the amount. In the example above, the scale is 36 |


NFTs are simply custom tokens with no decimal places i.e. they can only be spent whole.
