# Get started in 3 steps

Running a Minima node couldn't be easier, and if you choose to join our Incentive Program, you will earn 1 Reward each day your node is live!

Get started in 3 steps:
- 1. Register for the [Incentive Program](https://incentive.minima.global/account/register)
Please make sure you use an email address that you wonâ€™t lose access to.
- 2. Set up your node (see instructions below)
- 3. Connect your node to your Incentive Program account (see instructions below)

- 5) Once logged in, copy your **Node ID**

- 6) In the app, Paste your Incentive ID and Click **Update**

You will see your new Rewards balance updated. 
**Your Incentive Program account is now connected to your node!**



**Current rewards:** This is the total of old and new rewards. It includes any reward collections you previously missed that were paid to you at the Hard Fork.

**Last Ping:** This is the last date and time your node sent a PING message. For every day your node pings us, we'll add 1 Minima to your rewards. 

You can also check your balance from the Console. Swipe across to the Console and type incentivecash then Enter.

**Note:** There will temporarily be no MiniHub or MiniDapps - based on community feedback we are working hard to improve the MiniDapp system for a future release!
