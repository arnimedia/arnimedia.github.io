# Linux Desktop

We will be using Docker software to make running a Minima node simple.

Once your node is set up, you will be able to use Minima's decentralized applications.

:::note What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source software platform that simplifies the process of running, testing and managing applications. 
It uses the operating system of the computer on which itâ€™s installed to provide an independent computing environment for an application to run on.
::: 

## How to start a new Minima node

### Remove existing nodes

Before starting, stop any existing nodes you started manually by typing `quit` into the Terminal where the Minima logs are running.

### Start a new Minima node using Docker
1. Download and run the Docker installer from [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/). Please check your system requirements.
2. Once installed, open Docker
3. Click on the **settings** icon, and select **Start Docker Desktop when you log in**

![Windows_dockerstartup](/img/runanode/docker_desktopstartup.png)


3. Click **Apply & Restart**
4. Open the Linux Terminal
5. Copy and paste the following into the Terminal 

:::important SET YOUR PASSWORD
**Make sure to change the password below from `123` to a secure password using lowercase letters and numbers only of your choice. This will be the password to access your Minidapp Hub.**
:::
```
docker run -d -e minima_mdspassword=123 -e minima_desktop=true -v ~/minimadocker9001:/home/minima/data -p 9001-9004:9001-9004 --restart unless-stopped --name minima9001 minimaglobal/minima:latest
```
6. Press the **Enter** key to run the command and start your node. 

:::note What do all the parameters mean?

- `-d`: daemon mode, Minima will run in the background
- `-e minima_mdspassword=123` : sets the password for your MiniDapp system to 123. **YOU MUST USE A SECURE PASSWORD USING LOWERCASE LETTERS AND NUMBERS ONLY**
- `-e minima_desktop = true` : sets your node type as a desktop node that does not receive incoming connections 
- `-v ~/minimadocker9001:/home/minima/data` : creates a local folder called **minimadocker9001** in your home directory and maps it to the **/home/minima/data** directory in Docker. The **minimadocker9001** folder is where the Minima database and is also where your backups will be stored.
- `-p 9001-9004:9001-9004` : the port number mapping from your desktop to the Docker container
- `--restart unless-stopped` : ensures your container automatically restarts unless you stop it
- `--name minima9001` : sets the name of your Minima container to minima9001
- `minimaglobal/minima:latest` : specifies where to pull the Minima code from
:::

7. You will notice a container in Docker called **minima9001**, this is running your Minima node.

![Windows_dockercontainer](/img/runanode/docker_desktopcontainer.png)

8. Click on **minima9001** to check the logs and ensure your node has started up

![Windows_dockerlogs](/img/runanode/docker_desktoplogs.png)


**Congratulations - your node is now installed & running!**

To ensure your node updates automatically when a new version of Minima is released, continue to start a Watchtower container.

## How to automate updates with Watchtower
:::note What is a Watchtower container?
Once set up, a Watchtower container enables automatic updates of your Minima node when a new version is released. 
It will pull down the latest Minima version and restart with the same parameters you initially specified.
:::

Create the Watchtower container by pasting the following command into the Linux Terminal.

```
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name watchtower -e WATCHTOWER_CLEANUP=true -e WATCHTOWER_TIMEOUT=60s -e WATCHTOWER_POLL_INTERVAL=28800 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower
```
Press the **Enter** key to run the command and start the Watchtower. 

You will see the Watchtower in Docker.

![Desktop_dockerwatchtower](/img/runanode/docker_desktopwatchtower.png)

Every 8 hours, the Watchtower will check whether there is a new version of Minima and will update if so. 

Next, **[setup your Incentive Program account](/docs/runanode/incentivesetup)** to start earning Rewards.


## Set up your Incentive Program account 

The first time accessing your MiniDapp hub, you may need to pass through the security warning - see below - as the MiniDapp system currently uses self-signed certificates.

1. Go to **https://127.0.0.1:9003/** in your web browser

Click on **Advanced**, then **Proceed**. Or in Google Chrome, you may have to click anywhere on the page and type `thisisunsafe` to proceed. Details for other browsers can be found [**here**](https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-bypass-the-https-warning-for-self-signed-ssl-tls-certificates/).<br/>

You will see your MiniDapp System (MDS) login page. 

![mds_login](/img/runanode/mds_login.png#width50)

3. Enter your password to login, if you don't remember, you can check [here](#how-to-check-your-minima-hub-password).

4. You will see your MiniDapp hub!

5. Open the Incentive Program minidapp

![mds_IP](/img/runanode/IP_minidapp.png#width50)

6. Follow the instructions to login to the Incentive Program website and **copy your Incentive ID**

7. Paste your Incentive ID into the field provided and click **Update**

![mds_IP](/img/runanode/IP_updateid.png#width50)

8. Check the Rewards page to check your balance!

## FAQ 

### How to check your Minima hub password
You can use the Docker CLI/Terminal to interact with your node, for example to check your status, balance, password, incentive program setup or to create a backup.

1. From the Containers screen, click on **minima9001** to view the logs
2. Click on **CLI** or **Terminal** (depending on the version)

![Desktop_dockerlogs](/img/runanode/docker_desktopcli.png)

3. Type `minima` and press Enter, you will see the Minima Terminal appear
4. Type `mds`

![Desktop_dockerlogs](/img/runanode/docker_desktopterminal.png)


**Other useful commands:**<br/>
`status` - see the status of your node<br/>
`incentivecash` - check your Incentive Program balance<br/>
`incentivecash uid:` - setup your Incentive Program account by connecting your Incentive ID<br/>
`help` - show all commands


### How to start a second node in Docker

To run a second node in Docker, you can create another container using different port numbers, file path and name. 

For example to create a node on port 8001:

>docker run -d -e minima_mdspassword=123 -e minima_desktop=true -v ~/**minimadocker8001**:/home/minima/data -p **8001-8004**:9001-9004 --restart unless-stopped --name **minima8001** minimaglobal/minima:latest

:::note Port Mappings
**This creates a node on ports 8001-8004 on YOUR DESKTOP, this will be mapped to ports 9001-9004 in the Docker container.**
:::

### How to start a test node as a developer
To create a private test node from Genesis, use the following start up command:

> ```docker run -d -e minima_mdspassword=123 -e minima_desktop=true -e minima_genesis=true -e minima_test=true -e minima_nop2p=true -v ~/minimadocker10001_dev:/home/minima/data -p 10001-10004:9001-9004 --restart unless-stopped --name minima10001_dev minimaglobal/minima:latest```
:::note test parameters
The additional test parameters used are:

`-e minima_genesis=true` : Start a node from the Genesis block<br/>
`-e minima_test=true` : Use test parameters e.g. blocks are automined and block times are faster<br/>
`-e minima_nop2p=true` : Do not start the p2p system<br/>

To enable RPC, use `-p 10001-10005:9001-9005`
:::


### How to take a backup of your node

1. Login to your Minima Hub 
2. Open the Terminal MiniDapp
3. Enter the `backup` command, completing the parameters

```
backup password: file: auto: complete:
```
:::note backup parameters
**password:** set a password using **lowercase letters and numbers only** for your backup, this will be required when restoring it

**file:** (optional) backup name 

**auto:** (optional) **true** or **false**. Will set the backup to repeat every 24 hours.

**complete:** (optional) **true** or **false**. A complete backup includes the Archive database. Please allow more time for a complete backup to finish. 
:::

Your backup will go to the **minimadocker9001** folder in your home directory.

### How to restore your node from a backup

Your backup must be in the **minimadocker9001** folder in your home directory (as specified at start up).

1. Login to your Minima Hub 
2. Open the Terminal MiniDapp
3. Enter the `restore` command, completing the parameters

```
restore file: password:
```
:::note restore parameters
**password:** (optional) the password of the backup 

**file:** (optional) backup name, with or without file path
:::

If successful, you will need to log out/log in from your Minima hub for the restore to take effect.

### How to remove a node
:::important
**Removing a node without taking a backup will delete all your coins! Only remove a node if you have taken a backup or are running a test node.**
:::

To remove a Docker node:
1. Open Docker
2. Stop the **minima9001** container
3. Delete the container

![Desktop_dockerlogs](/img/runanode/docker_desktopremove.png)

This will not remove the  **minimadocker9001** folder from your home directory, so if you subsequently create a new container with the same name, the same folder will be reused. 

To start a clean node (and lose your balance) you must provide a new name for the folder in the start up command or delete this folder from your Home directory.
